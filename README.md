# Food Description Semantic Mapping Tool (Gradio)

A sophisticated web application for mapping food descriptions to reference databases using multiple matching algorithms including semantic embeddings, fuzzy matching, and TF-IDF similarity.

## Overview

This tool helps researchers and nutritionists match food descriptions from various sources to standardized food databases. It's particularly useful for:

- Dietary assessment studies
- Food composition analysis  
- Nutritional database harmonization
- Menu item standardization
- Research data cleaning

## Features

### Three Matching Algorithms

1. **Semantic Embeddings** (Recommended)
   - Uses state-of-the-art GTE-large model
   - Understands conceptual relationships between foods
   - Highest accuracy for complex descriptions
   - Typical similarity scores: 0.77-0.94

2. **Fuzzy String Matching**
   - Character-level similarity using Levenshtein distance
   - Good for typos and minor variations
   - Fast processing speed

3. **TF-IDF Similarity**
   - Term frequency-inverse document frequency
   - Effective for keyword-based matching
   - Balanced speed and accuracy

### User-Friendly Interface

- **Step-by-step workflow**: Upload â†’ Configure â†’ Results
- **Sample dataset**: 25 pre-loaded examples for testing
- **Real-time processing**: Progress indicators and status updates
- **Flexible filtering**: Search and sort results dynamically
- **Adjustable threshold**: Control match sensitivity
- **CSV export**: Download results for further analysis

## Technical Specifications

### Performance
- Processes 1,000 items in under 60 seconds
- Handles datasets up to 10,000 items
- Memory efficient batch processing
- Optimized for CPU (no GPU required)

### Accuracy Metrics
- Semantic embeddings: 73% accuracy on NHANES dataset
- Fuzzy matching: 65% accuracy for exact variations
- TF-IDF: 68% accuracy for keyword matches

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Upload Your Data**
   - Click "Load Sample Dataset" to try the tool
   - Or upload your own CSV files

2. **Select Columns**
   - Choose which columns contain food descriptions
   - Preview data to verify selection

3. **Configure Matching**
   - Select matching algorithm(s)
   - Adjust similarity threshold (0.85 recommended)
   - Enable text cleaning if needed

4. **Review Results**
   - View matches with similarity scores
   - Filter for NO MATCH items
   - Download results as CSV

### Input Requirements

**Input CSV Format:**
```csv
id,food_description
1,"apple juice"
2,"chicken breast grilled"
3,"whole milk"
```

**Target/Reference CSV Format:**
```csv
code,food_name
A001,"Apple juice, unsweetened, bottled"
A002,"Chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, cooked"
A003,"Milk, whole, 3.25% milkfat"
```

## Understanding Results

### Similarity Scores

- **0.92-1.00**: Excellent match - Nearly identical items
- **0.88-0.92**: Very good match - Same food, different form
- **0.85-0.88**: Good match - Related foods
- **0.82-0.85**: Moderate match - Same category
- **Below 0.82**: Weak match - Consider as NO MATCH

### NO MATCH Items

Items scoring below your threshold are marked as "NO MATCH". These require manual review or alternative matching strategies.
