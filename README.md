# Food Database Mapper

A sophisticated web application for mapping food descriptions to reference databases using multiple matching algorithms including semantic embeddings, fuzzy matching, and TF-IDF similarity.

## Repository & Hosting

- **Source Code**: <a href="https://github.com/RichardStoker-USDA/Food-Database-Mapper" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a> - Primary location for code and documentation
- **Live Application**: <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/richtext/Food-Database-Mapper" target="_blank">Food Database Mapper, hosted via HuggingFace Spaces</a> - With ZeroGPU for GPU-accelerated processing
- **Deployment**: Automatic CI/CD from GitHub to HuggingFace Spaces via GitHub Actions

## Overview

This tool helps researchers and nutritionists match food descriptions from various sources to standardized food databases. It's particularly useful for:

- Dietary assessment studies
- Food composition analysis  
- Nutritional database harmonization
- Menu item standardization
- Research data cleaning

### User-Friendly Interface

- **Step-by-step workflow**: Upload â†’ Configure â†’ Results
- **Sample dataset**: 25 pre-loaded examples for testing
- **Real-time processing**: Progress indicators and status updates
- **Flexible filtering**: Search and sort results dynamically
- **Adjustable threshold**: Control match sensitivity
- **CSV export**: Download results for further analysis

## Technical Specifications

### Performance
- Maximum dataset size: 50,000 items per file (demo limit)
- Batch processing for datasets over 30,000 items
- GPU-accelerated embeddings for faster processing

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Upload Your Data**
   - Click "Load Sample Dataset" to try the tool
   - Or upload your own CSV files

2. **Select Columns**
   - Choose which columns contain food descriptions
   - Preview data to verify selection

3. **Configure Matching**
   - Select matching algorithm
   - Adjust similarity threshold (0.85 recommended)

4. **Review Results**
   - View matches with similarity scores
   - Filter for NO MATCH items
   - Download results as CSV

### Input Requirements

**Input CSV Format:**
```csv
id,food_description
1,"apple juice"
2,"chicken breast grilled"
3,"whole milk"
```

**Target/Reference CSV Format:**
```csv
code,food_name
A001,"Apple juice, unsweetened, bottled"
A002,"Chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, cooked"
A003,"Milk, whole, 3.25% milkfat"
```

## Understanding Results

### Similarity Scores

- **0.92-1.00**: Excellent match - Nearly identical items
- **0.88-0.92**: Very good match - Same food, different form
- **0.85-0.88**: Good match - Related foods
- **0.82-0.85**: Moderate match - Same category
- **Below 0.82**: Weak match - Consider as NO MATCH (if using default similarity threshold)

### NO MATCH Items

Items scoring below your threshold are marked as "NO MATCH". These require manual review or alternative matching strategies.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
python >= 3.11
pip >= 23.0
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository  
git clone https://github.com/RichardStoker-USDA/Food-Database-Mapper.git
cd Food-Database-Mapper

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run application
python app.py
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t food-mapping-gradio .

# Run container
docker run -p 7860:7860 food-mapping-gradio
```

## Important Limitations (Demo Version)

### Dataset Size Limits
- **Maximum 50,000 items per file** for the shared demo
- This limit ensures fair GPU usage across all users
- For larger datasets, please run locally with your own GPU

### GPU Resources
- Shared demo has a 2-minute GPU processing limit
- Daily GPU consumption caps apply
- Automatic batching for datasets over 30,000 items

### Local Installation for Large Datasets
For processing more than 50,000 items, install locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RichardStoker-USDA/Food-Database-Mapper.git
cd Food-Database-Mapper
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Data Privacy

- All processing happens in your session
- No data is stored permanently on servers
- Files are deleted after session ends
- No external API calls for data processing
